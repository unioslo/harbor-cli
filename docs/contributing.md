# Contributing

`harbor-cli` is an open source project, and contributions are welcome. This document outlines the development process.

## Development environment

Start by cloning the repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:unioslo/harbor-cli.git
```

Use [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) to set up the required development environments.

```
hatch env create
```

Enter the development environment:

```
hatch shell
```

See the [Hatch docs](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/environment/) for more information on environments.

## Pre-commit hooks

The code is linted and formatted using a pre-commmit configuration consisting of tools such as [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), [reorder_python_imports](https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports) and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/).

Install pre-commit:

```
pip install pre-commit
```

Install the pre-commit hooks:

```
pre-commit install
```

Run the pre-commit hooks:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing

Hatch supports testing against multiple Python versions, similar to [Tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) and [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/).

To run the test suite for the current environment:

```
hatch run test
```

Run the test suite for all supported Python versions:

```
hatch run test:test
```

Tests are run in CI, but it's a good idea to run them locally before pushing changes.

## Documentation

The documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). To serve the documentation locally:

```
hatch run docs:serve
```

To build the documentation:

```
hatch run docs:build
```

## Changelog

TBD

## Pull requests

When submitting a pull request, please make sure to run the pre-commit hooks and tests locally before pushing. This will ensure a smoother review process.

## Releasing

!!! attention "On versioning"

    In general, managing releases and versioning should only be handled by the project maintainer(s), but it is documented here for completeness.

Releases are handled by a GitHub actions workflow found [here](https://github.com/unioslo/harbor-cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml). Whenever a new tag whose name starts `harbor-cli-v` is pushed to the repository on the `main` branch, the workflow will build and publish a new release to PyPI.

```
$ python scripts/bump_version.py --help

 Usage: bump_version.py [OPTIONS] [major|minor|patch|x.y.z],[release|a|a
                        lpha|b|beta|c|rc|pre|preview|r|rev|post|dev]

 Bump the version of the project and create a new git tag.
 Examples:
 $ python bump_version.py minor
 $ python bump_version.py major,rc
 $ python bump_version.py 1.2.3 # generally don't use this

╭─ Arguments ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

```

To assist in bumping versions and tagging correctly, there is a script in `scripts/bump_version.py` that shares the same interface as `hatch version`.

The tool will automatically update the version in `harbor_cli/__about__.py`, and create a new git tag with the bumped version number (`harbor-cli-vx.y.z`).

Pushing the new tag to the remote repository will trigger a new release.

```
git push origin --tags
```


### Bumping

#### Major version

Major releases are used to indicate breaking changes. Breaking changes are changes that break backwards compatibility, such as removing or renaming a command or option, changing the configuration file format, or changing the behavior of an existing command.

```
python scripts/bump_version.py major
```

#### Minor version

Minor releases are used to indicate new features that maintain backwards compatibility. New commands and new options are considered new features.

```
python scripts/bump_version.py minor
```

#### Patch version

Patch releases are used to indicate bug fixes, refactoring, and other minor non-feature changes that maintain backwards compatibility.

```
python scripts/bump_version.py patch
```

### Status suffixes
#### Bump and pre-release

Sometimes we want to publish a pre-release version to allow users to test the new version before it is officially released.

```
python scripts/bump_version.py major,pre
```

#### Release candidate

Graduating to release candidate is not necessary, but can sometimes be useful to indicate that the release is feature-complete and ready for testing, but not yet ready for general use due to possible minor bugs or missing/incomplete documentation.

```
python scripts/bump_version.py major,rc
```

#### Release

Going from a pre-release or a release candidate to a release is done by removing the status suffix:

```
python scripts/bump_version.py release
```
