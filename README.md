## Installation


The name `harbor-cli` is in the process of being acquired from its current owner on PyPI.

In the meantime, you can install the package from GitHub,:

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/pederhan/harbor-cli
```

On certain platforms this is not sufficient to install all [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) dependencies.

Keyring functionality is not mandatory, and the application will function without it. Consult your platform's section below for more information.


### MacOS

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/pederhan/harbor-cli
```

Keyring should work out of the box on MacOS >=11 with Python >=3.8.7.


### Linux

Depending on your Linux flavor and choice of keyring backend, you may need to install additional packages. See the [keyring documentation](https://keyring.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installing-keyring) for more information.

To inject a package into the application's pipx environment, use the `pipx inject` command:


```
pipx install git+https://github.com/pederhan/harbor-cli
pipx inject harbor-cli <package to inject>
```

Follow the instructions for your Linux flavor and keyring backend to determine which package to inject (if any). If a package requires compilation and you don't have the necessary prerequisites installed, installing the package as a system package through your system's package manager may be easier.

### Windows

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/pederhan/harbor-cli
```

Keyring functionality is untested on Windows, but should work out of the box. If you run into any issues, consult the [keyring documentation](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring#readme) for more information. Otherwise, please open an issue.




## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://pederhan.github.io/harbor-cli/).

The documentation includes extensive setup and usage guides, as well as a list of all commands and their options.

## Usage


Installing the application puts `harbor` in your `PATH`, and can be invoked by typing `harbor` in your terminal:

```console
$ harbor --help
```



<!-- Cut before here -->

### Quick Start ðŸš€


**1. Initialize configuration**

```
harbor init
```

After completing the configuration wizard, the application can be run in any of the following modes:

**2a. Run commands directly**

```
harbor <command>
```

## Examples

Most commands produce some sort of table. While the most common methods have nice hand-written tables, some of the tables are generated automatically from the data returned by the API.

PRs are always welcome if you wish to add a new table or improve an existing one.
