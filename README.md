## Installation

<!-- ```console
pip install harbor-cli
``` -->

The name `harbor-cli` is in the process of being acquired from its current owner on PyPI.

In the meantime, you can install the package from GitHub, preferably with `pipx`:

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/pederhan/harbor-cli
```

Before the name acquisition process is complete, semantic versioning will not be adhered to and breaking changes may be introduced at any point. Once the package is available on PyPI, semantic versioning will be adhered to and breaking changes will only be introduced in major version updates.

## Features

- [150+ commands](https://pederhan.github.io/harbor-cli/commands/)
- Beautiful command-line interface powered by [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) and [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).
- REPL mode (`harbor repl`)
- Tab completion for commands and options.
- Automatic retrying of failed requests
- Multiple output formats:
    - Table
    - JSON
- Large number of configuration options
    - Authentication methods
    - Table styling
    - Output formats
    - ... and more

## Examples

Most commands produce some sort of table. While the most common methods have nice hand-written tables, some of the tables are generated automatically from the data returned by the API.

PRs are always welcome if you wish to add a new table or improve an existing one.
